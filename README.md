## Decentralized Pre-Trained Transformers (DPT)
A Decentralized Pre-Trained Transformer (DPT) is a tokenized AI system with specialized functionality and embedded
liquidity, offering a range of services. It can issue unique digital assets, termed "Keys", addressing the issue of low
liquidity in blockchain-based assets.

Any ERC721 Token (NFT) can be converted into a DPT using AI protocol smart contracts. To convert an ERC721 Token (NFT)
into a DPT you must own that NFT.
